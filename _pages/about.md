In 2019 I completed my undergraduate studies in Mechanical Engineering and started my path in research, with several projects in different areas such as robotics, autonomous navigation, non-intrusive monitoring and biomechanics. In 2022 I combined part of these projects with a Masters in Industrial Engineering, which I managed to finish in 2024.

Currently, I am pursuing my PhD entitled "Control and optimisation techniques for efficient and sustainable integration of desalination technologies in CSP plants" at the Solar Thermal Applications Unit of the Almer√≠a Solar Platform, part of the Research Centre for Energy, Environment and Technology (CIEMAT).
